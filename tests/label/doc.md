# All controls must have a label

All form elements must have a label.  There are a number of ways to associate labels with a for control.

## Rational

When a screen reader focuses on a form control the label is read out so they understand what the purpose of the control is.
While sighted users can infer a controls label from the layout of the page, this is difficult or impossible for a screen reader user.
Many users will tab between controls and never see text before or after the control so it is essential all text that must be read as part
of a control, including help tips and error messages, is associated with the control.
